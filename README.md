# Weather-Monitoring-Solution
I'm having a weird error.
The type or namespace name 'WriteLine' does not exist in the namespace 'WeatherMonitoringStation.Console' (are you missing an assembly reference?)CS0234
I added using system to the top of Program.cs but Console.WriteLine is mad at me!
This is the normal c# command, why would it be an error???

Now trying to be creative... Head hurts. Sigh!
